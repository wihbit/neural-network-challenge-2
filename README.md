# Neural Network Challenge 2

## Objectives
- Load and encode employee attrition dataset to prepare it for machine learning
- Build, compile, and fit a branched neural network using Keras to predict two target variables:
    1. Department: Which of 3 possible departments an employee works in
    2. Attrition: Whether or not an employee left the company/position
- Employ sigmoid and softmax correctly for binary and categorical predictions
- Evaluate model performance
- Consider the significance of accuracy as a model performance metric
- Speculate on ways to improve the model
